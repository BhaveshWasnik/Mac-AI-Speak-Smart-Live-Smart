# 🤖 Mac AI – Speak Smart, Live Smart

This is my personal project — a **Mac AI – Speak Smart, Live Smart** made using the **MERN Stack** and **Gemini AI API**.  
It can chat, understand voice commands, and give intelligent responses like a smart AI helper.  
I built it to practice full-stack development and learn how AI integrates with web apps.
